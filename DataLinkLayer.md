## Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer is the second layer in the OSI Model. 

After receiving data from the Physical layer, the responsibilities of the Data Link Layer are to verify if there are any transmission issues and stores bits into frames of data. This layer is also responsible for managing physical addressing schemes by controlling the entry of network devices to the physical medium.
