# How The OSI Layers Work Together in the OSI Model
### By: Hailey Jessee
This tutorial is an explanation on the different layers of the OSI model. This tutorial focuses on the specifics of each layer as well as how they all work together to make up the OSI model.

My intended target audience is for those who deal with networks on a daily basis whether it be for a job or class as well as those that are interested in learning more about this subject. People who are very interested in networks and computers are ideal for this target audience range. As far as age range goes, I would say anyone who is between 14-55 would be interested in learning more about this.
