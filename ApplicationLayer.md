## Application Layer

The Application Layer is the seventh and final layer in the OSI Model.

The responsibilities of this layer is to be the interface of data for the end user by providing network services. This layer contains HTTP packages and data needed to both receive and send website contents. This data is obtained from the presentation layer.

##### This concludes the tutorial of how an OSI Model works. I hope you understand more about what makes up the OSI Network and how an end result develops throughout layers.
