## Network Layer

The Network Layer is the third layer in the OSI Model. 

The Network Layer is the third layer in the OSI model. After the data from the Data Link Layer gets to the Network Layer, The responsibilities of the network layer are to check the source and destination addresses within each frame to see if it needs to be sent to another destination or if it has reached it's last destination. If this is the last destination, the Network Layer constructs the data into packets to send to the Transport Layer. If this data needs to be rerouted to previous layers, the Network Layer updates it's address to be sent to lower levels.

The Network Layer is also responsible for being the  keeper of logical addresses and mapping between the physical and logical addresses for all the devices within the network.
